       <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
       <p class="description">Swedish meatballs, or köttbullar, must be prepared, above all, with love. This is why homemade meatballs are a widespread concept in Sweden, and there are many different favourite recipes - with and without meat.</p>
       
       
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Finely dice the onion and sauté gently in a little butter without browning. Soak the breadcrumbs in milk. Blend the ground meat, preferably in a food processor, with the onion, egg, milk-breadcrumb mixture and the spices to the proper consistency and taste. Add a little water if the mixture feels too firm.</li>
        <li>Check the taste by test-frying one meatball. Then shape small meatballs with the aid of two spoons and place on water-rinsed plates.</li>
        <li>Brown a generous pat of butter in a frying pan, and when it "goes quiet" place the meatballs in the pan and let them brown on all sides. Shake the frying pan often.</li>
        <li>For the gravy, melt the butter in a pan. Stir in the flour. Add the stock little by little, while stirring. Bring to the boil and simmer for 3-5 minutes. Add cream and flavour with soy, pepper and the optional apple sauce or jelly.</li>
        <li>Serve with mashed or boiled potatoes and raw stirred lingonberries.</li>
       </ol>
